proDUCKtive

proDUCKtive helps you solve tough problems by offering simple solutions 
and reminders that will set you on the right track. 
Got a program that doesn't seem to be working right? Need someone to explain your code to?
Unsure what step to take next? Just ask your proDUCKtive little helper, rubber duck🐤.


How does it work:
1. Get a problem
2. Click on the "Quack!" button
3. See what rubber duck's solution is 

proDUCKtive is based on the software engineering concept of rubber duck debugging which is a way for 
programmers to debug their code and solve problems efficiently. Of course, this concept also applies to anyone with a problem to solve🤔. 
By explaining your problem in detail, and with a little extra help from rubber duck's suggestions😉, you can easily solve any problem you put your mind to!💪


proDUCKtive comes with a predefined set of responses. You can modify those responses 
and even add your own in the options page.

Other creative and fun uses for proDUCKtive rubber duck:
- random task generator/selector for when you don't know what project to work on
- sticky notes for quickly jotting things down
- joke generator for when you need some cheering up 😂 (just be sure to add something funny in your duck's possible responses)
